### Automated Programming


### Automated Code Generation

In the context of automated code generation for the `anscombe_quartet_analysis` codebase, the original `main_test.go` file was removed, necessitating its recreation. To achieve this, a Yacc/Bison (.y) file was developed, defining the grammar and rules for generating the test file. This Yacc file specifies the structure and expected content of the test cases, including functions like `checkDataQuality`, `linearRegression`, `calculateRSquared`, and `Correlation`, as well as utility functions like `almostEqual` for floating-point comparison.

The process involved several steps:
1. **Generating the Lexer and Parser**: Using tools like `go tool yacc`, the .y file and a corresponding lexer file were parsed to generate a Go source file.
2. **Compiling the Code**: The `go build` command was used to compile the generated files and ensure they were free of syntax errors.
3. **Running the Code Generator**: `go generate` was utilized to automate the creation of boilerplate code.
4. **Executing the Generated Code**: The `go run` command was used to compile and execute the generated program, ensuring alignment with expected behavior.
5. **Running the Tests**: The `go test -v` command executed the test cases, providing verbose output for better debugging.

### Downsides and Limitations

1. **Mismatch with Original Test Cases**: The generated file does not replicate the original `main_test.go`, which contained specific test cases for critical functions. The parser focuses on arithmetic expressions, missing the original function tests.
2. **Limited Utility**: The parser does not provide practical test coverage for the codebase's functions, which is not aligned with the purpose of the original test file.
3. **Lack of Test Scenarios**: The generated file lacks comprehensive test scenarios for validating function functionality and edge cases, potentially leaving gaps in test coverage.
4. **Manual Effort Required**: Without the original test cases, developers must manually recreate them, which is time-consuming and error-prone.

### Conclusion

While `goyacc` is powerful for generating parsers, it is unsuitable for regenerating specific test cases unless explicitly defined in the grammar and actions. This situation highlights the importance of maintaining comprehensive test cases and documentation to ensure that automated tools can accurately recreate essential files when needed.
